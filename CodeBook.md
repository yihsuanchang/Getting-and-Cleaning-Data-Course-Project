### Goal of the projest

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Steps to complete the goal

1. load packages and get the data

2. set working directory and the URL

3. load activities labels and features

4. get mean and standard deviation from each feature

5. remove unneccessary mark 

6. load train and test data

7. merge train and test dataset to one dataset called combined

8. convert classLabels to activityName

9. transform dataset

10. export dataset
